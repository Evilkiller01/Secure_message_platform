# 🔒 Message Encryption and Decryption with Secret Key

This project provides a simple way to encrypt and decrypt messages using a secret key. It ensures that sensitive information stays secure and can only be accessed by those who have the correct key.

## ✨ Features
- **Secret Key-Based Encryption**: Messages are encrypted using a user-provided key.
- **Secure Decryption**: Only the matching key can decrypt the message.
- **Lightweight & Fast**: Minimal dependencies and quick performance.
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Easy to understand and use for learning basic cryptography concepts.

## 📋 How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Evilkiller01/Secure_message_platform.git
2. Navigate to the Project Folder
